<p>You have descended into the Infernal Depths. The air is thick with smoke and the scent of brimstone. Flames lick at the edges of your vision, casting eerie shadows on the rocky landscape.</p>
<p>But Hell is not just a place of torment; it's a realm of challenge and transformation. Here, in the crucible of the underworld, you will face your deepest fears and darkest desires.</p>
<p>The path ahead is treacherous, filled with deception and trials. Yet, for those with the strength to endure, great power and knowledge await. Your journey through Hell will forge you anew.</p>";
