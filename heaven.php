<p>You have ascended to the Celestial Heights. The air is filled with a soft, golden light, and the sound of angelic choirs echoes in the distance. Peace and serenity surround you.</p>
<p>Here, in the realm of eternal bliss, you find yourself free from earthly concerns. The beauty of this place is beyond mortal comprehension, with landscapes of clouds and light stretching as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>But remember, even in paradise, there are lessons to learn and growth to achieve. Your journey is far from over; it has only taken on a new, divine aspect.</p>";
